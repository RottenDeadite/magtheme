A Magento 2 Theme that never saw the light of day

This theme is intended for educational use only and may not be used on a live environment. Do not distribute this theme.

Key features of this theme include:

Extensions developed to facilitate use of the Magento 2 jQueryUI dropdown-widget.

A conversion from CSS to LESS, single-file for rapid compilation.

UI Icon font care of icomoon.

Modification of menu JS for mobile menu and touch behavior at non-default breakpoints.

Other things I can't remember because it's been a clean year since I touched this theme.
